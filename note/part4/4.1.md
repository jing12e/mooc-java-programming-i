4.1 Introduction to object-oriented programming
===
1 Classes and Objects
---
2 Creating Classes
---
3 Defining a Constructor
---
4 Defining Methods For an Object
---
5 Changing an instance variable's value in a method
---
add growOlder() method 

```java
public void growOlder() {
    this.age = this.age + 1;
}
```
6 Returning a value from a method
------
void - the method does not return a value 

the method below returns an `int` type variable of value 10
```java
public class Teacher {
    public int grade() {
        return 10;
    }
}
```
For the return value to be used, it needs to be assigned to a variable.
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Teacher teacher = new Teacher();

    int grading = teacher.grade();

    System.out.println("The grade received is " + grading);
}
```
The return value could also be used to form part of an expression.
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Teacher first = new Teacher();
    Teacher second = new Teacher();
    Teacher third = new Teacher();

    double average = (first.grade() + second.grade() + third.grade()) / 3.0;

    System.out.println("Grading average " + average);
}
```
Methods can have conditionals or loops, and other methods can also be called from them.
```java
public class Person {
    // ...

    public boolean isOfLegalAge() {
        if (this.age < 18) {
            return false;
        }

        return true;
    }

    /*
     The method could have been written more succinctly in the following way:

    public boolean isOfLegalAge() {
        return this.age >= 18;
    }
    */
}
```
7 A string representation of an object and the toString-method
---
The method returning the string representation is always `toString` in Java.
```java
public class Person {
    // ...

    public String toString() {
        return this.name + ", age " + this.age + " years";
    }
}
```
It doesn't itself print anything but instead returns a string representation.
```java
System.out.println(antti);
// same as System.out.println(antti.toString());
System.out.println(pekka); 
// same as System.out.println(pekka.toString());
```
8 Method parameters
---
If the method's only purpose is to set a value to an instance variable, then it's named as `setVariableName`. 
Value-setting methods are often called "setters".

9 A parameter and instance variable having the same name!
---
```java
public void setHeight(int newHeight) {
    this.height = newHeight;
}
//height - instance variablle
//setHeight - method
//newHeight - parameter
```
The parameter's name could also be the same as the instance variable's.
```java
public void setHeight(int height) {
    this.height = height;
    //height = height Don't do this!!!
}
```
10 Calling an internal method
---
When an object calls an internal method, the `name of the method` and `this` prefix suffice. 
```java
public String toString() {
    return this.name + ", age " + this.age + " years, my body mass index is " + this.bodyMassIndex();
}
```
An alternative way is to call the object's own method in the form `bodyMassIndex()`.
```java
public String toString() {
    return this.name + ", age " + this.age + " years, my body mass index is " + bodyMassIndex();
}
```
11 tips
---
 `return`
1 return to the value (in the method which return a value)
2 finish the execute of the method (in the method doesn't return a value, `void`)
