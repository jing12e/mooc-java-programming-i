- [material](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/part-4/3-files-and-reading-data)
- review reading keyboard input
- what a file and a filesystem are
- are able to add an empty text file into the filesystem
- how to write a program that reads data from a file
  
1 Reading From the Keyboard
---
`Scanner`-class
```java
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
```
pass system input (System.in) as a parameter to the constructor of the Scanner-class

2 Files and the Filesystem
---
- **Files**
  - are collections of data that live in computers
  - Files can exist practically anywhere on a hard drive, even separated into multiple pieces.
- **filesystem** 
  - keeping track of the locations of files on the hard drive
  - providing the ability to create new files and modify them.

3 Reading From a File
---
`Paths.get`
`Paths.get("filename.extension")`

```java
// first
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.nio.file.Paths;

// in the program:

// we create a scanner for reading the file
try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(Paths.get("file.txt"))) {

    // we read the file until all lines have been read
    while (scanner.hasNextLine()) {
        // we read one line
        String row = scanner.nextLine();
        // we print the line that we read
        System.out.println(row);
    }
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
}
```
Read all the lines of the file "file.txt", which are then added to an `ArrayList`.
```java
ArrayList<String> lines = new ArrayList<>();

// we create a scanner for reading the file
try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(Paths.get("file.txt"))) {

    // we read all the lines of the file
    while (scanner.hasNextLine()) {
        lines.add(scanner.nextLine());
    }
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
}

// we print the total number of lines
System.out.println("Total lines: " + lines.size());
```
